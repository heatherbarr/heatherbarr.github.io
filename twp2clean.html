<p>Throughout our life, we collect an amazing amount of clutter that at one point may have held significant meaning in our life that we no longer value in the same way anymore. Sometimes it is difficult to part ways with such clutter even though it no longer sparks us joy. I have chosen to live in the ways that <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=marie+kondo&oq=marie+kondo&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqBwgAEAAYjwIyBwgAEAAYjwIyDQgBEC4YgwEYsQMYgAQyCggCEAAYsQMYgAQyDQgDEAAYgwEYsQMYgAQyBwgEEAAYgAQyBwgFEAAYgAQyCggGEC4YsQMYgAQyBwgHEAAYgAQyBwgIEAAYgAQyCggJEC4Y1AIYgATSAQgyMDc5ajBqN6gCALACAA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8">Marie Kondo</a>, the famous organizer, has taught many people to tidy up their spaces and find peace in a relatively clutter free life.

It is really difficult to part with things that many people consider to be trash, but is something that you treasure and still see value and potential in. Luckily the idea to do a project like this came at a perfect time, as I need to move to a new house soon. Therefore, now is the perfect time to declutter my belongings and part ways with what no longer serves me. 
	<br>
	<br>
I think that this project will also help me be mindful of what I am using, and how I can live life more sustainably by consciously knowing what will last long and what does not. I think it is better for me to not take any items that won’t be durable or serve as single use. Now I can focus on what items are important and well made, and try to discard things that are not with ease.</p>

	<h2 id="Overview"> Overview</h2>
	<p> Decluttering is something that is linked to seasonality for me. I think through this project I have begun to recognize that I am a bit of a hoarder when it comes to items I have collected over time that I believe to be useful if a situation ever so happens that I may need such item.It should be noted that this rare situations have never occurred, thus rendering these items to collect dust. 
		<br>
	<br>
		Throughout these week, I have decided to discard items that can be classified as <strong>electronics, storage, accessories.</strong> To start off:</p>

		
    <div class="container">
    <div class="column">
<h3>Electronics</h3>
		 
 <p>This category includes my charger, and my curling iron. My white charger which used to be my fast charger from Samsung that came with my laptop, was my reliable charger that worked better than everything else. However the end of it broke and now the wiring got so loose it doesn't charge my devices anymore. My Curling iron was something that I had borrowed from my mother, but never gave back to her. It was my favorite iron to use and worked great until it would refuse to stay on and would randomly turn off while curling my hair. It was a sign that it was time to go, except I have held on to it for at least a year even though it hasn't worked. Now I am ready to move on to a different iron.</p>
			 </div>
			 
    <div class="column">
<h3>Storage</h3>
		 
<p>Included here is the box to my heated blanket, which I used to hold my blanket between uses, except I just gave up putting it back and just left the blanket on my bed. My old field hockey bag is an item that I have refused to get rid of due to the idea that I would one day play again with friends. We haven't ever committed to such plans. I haven't played field hockey since middle school. My coin case that was from a collection of New York quarters I had taken from work because my mom likes to keep quaters. However, I never did give her the coin case until now. I also liked it because it says New York and my family is originally from Brooklyn before moving to Jersey. The old jewelry box is something that collected dust and held items I never looked at for years. Once I became older, I never used it cause I thought it looked ugly and childish. It would be nice if I didn't paint a bunch of glitter nail polish all over it though.</p>
				  </div>
				  
	<div class="column">
   
<h3>Accessories </h3>
		
<p>Lastly this category includes my glasses, which I have a bad habit of buying new ones every time I can't find a pair. These glasses got lost, then found, except they were so scratched and broken. You can't see out of them. They have just collected dust on my shelf. The finger light from a concert this past summer is something I have absolutely no use for, it is purwly kept as memorabilia. Lastly, my broken platform shoes which I loved and worn every day till the sole tore in half. I had a difficult time parting with these shoes, I know they were cheap but I just could not throw them away. I wanted to fix them but knew I would never actually fix them nor would they last much longer even if I did.</p>

	<h2>Item of the Week</h2>
	<p>The item of the week is my <em>Jewelry box</em>. I do not exactly remember how I acquired this box except I do know that it is something that has always been around for as long as I can remember. I have many memories with this jewelry box from using it to stash stolen items from my sister’s room, a canvas for me to experiment with different nail polish colors, and of course a place to store my jewelry. Over the years I had lost drawers, found drawers, used drawers not in the box instead of putting them back in, but I truly wish I treated this jewelry box with more care. Granted I cannot be too hard on myself cause as a child I was not concerned with the longevity of my items. In looking into this Jewelry box, I cannot find where it is from, but it looks very generic in terms as many personalized ones are now sold on etsy today. The construction of the box itself is produced with wood, there is a glass mirror on the interior.
</p>

<p>After this week, I think I feel like I have achieved something. Some of these items I have owned for many years, decades even, that just collected dust. I am glad to have looked back on my time with these items and have also realized that it is okay to let things go. These items for good for me at some point in my life, but now they just took up space. I did not realize how stressed I was about the collection of clutter that surrounded me until I started removing it from my life. I now feel lighter and at ease. Hopefully in the following weeks I can keep up the energy.</p>

	  <p>Hello, I am Heather. Currently a Junior studying ITI at Rutgers University. I am a commuter student and am taking on this project to improve and learn to better myself about how I handle my 'trash' and declutter my life. Also clean my room cause it was messy and needed some good TLC. I have a habit of cleaning and reorganizing my room at night, clearly I am a night owl. When I am not at Rutgers, you can most likely find me at a concert. My favorite artists right now is One Ok Rock. I think life without music would be unbearable for me. Besides concerts, I also am a fan of kpop and am a member of HARU, Rutgers Kpop dance club. I think dance is something that I have recently become more passionate about. In fact I have prioritized it more over Tennis which is my favorite hobby, and used to play competitevly prior to college. Circling back to the concept of trash, I was once very passionate about the Environment and was the President of my high school's Environmental Club. I think that society today has lost its touch with the idea of using products that focus on longevity. I hope that through this project, I can analyze my own items, their lifespan, and see how I chose to discard things.   </p>
	<h3>Disposal locations</h3>
	<ol>
	<li></li>
		<p><strong>home trash can</strong>
			<br>
			<br>
	  my trust dusty trash can at home, that used to be an electric trash bin, except we have not changed the batteries and a while. due to this we just took of the top. </p>
	<li></li>
		<p><strong>outdoor trash</strong>
			<br>
			<br>
	  This is the trash can, that i run to late at night in the dark and pray no animals are lurking around it. We have lots of cute trash pandas, aka racoons. except for my actual panda art project that I left outside for years which could also be considered a trash panda. It has now become one with the earth.</p>
	<li></li> 
		<p><strong>clothing donation bin</strong>
			<br>
			<br>
		
		This bin resides down the street from my house and had recieved many of the clothes I no longer wear</p>
