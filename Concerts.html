		<h3>What it is like to see your favorite artists live.</h3>
		<p>
		Kpop Concerts are nothing like the typical western concert experience that one may be accustomed to. For kpop fans, concerts are an all day event that encompass multiple fun activities throughout the day prior to the actual concert itself. Some fans are crazy enough to camp out for the concert overnight in hopes of reaching the front of the crowd. I am not one of those people. However, it is extremely recommended to show up early if one wants to take part in the pre-show festivities. Many kpop concerts often have Merchandise stands outside the venue that open up at noon the day of the concert and will close around 5pm or 2 hours prior to the venue doors opening. This is the perfect opportunity to grab a lightstick before it sells out. However once doors open there will be a second opportunity to grab merchandise for those that cannot show up early due to obligations such as work or school. Although this does pose a challenge as the later you arrive at a venue the less of a chance you have of getting merchandise. I personally have faced this twice where I stood in line for a while just to witness the last lightstick be bought right in front of me. 
<br>
Once one secures merchandise, they are free to roam around and mingle with other fans. Prior to the start time of the show, many fans will be passing out freebies such as fan-made photocards and friendship bracelets to people around. It is also important to try and grab a banner that was made specifically for the concert by a fan led group project. Most venues either have boxes of them at the entrance with staff handing them out or volunteers of the fan project will pass them out while everyone is  lined up waiting to get inside the venue. 
<br>
The most fun aspect of waiting for a Kpop concert to start is partaking in a Kpop random dance play. Someone or a group of fans, most often a Kpop cover group, will initiate a random dance play and fans will circle around to participate or spectate upon. This ranges from 30 minutes to an hour depending on the playlist chosen. This activity consists of approximately 30 seconds of a kpop song's chorus and fans will all dance the choreo if they know it. Many fans prior to a kpop concert will spend hours learning a bunch of different Kpop Choreographies to participate in this activity. Sometimes even the kpop idols themselves join in the random dance plays. For instance at the 2018 BTS concert in Newark, Suga, the main rapper of the group joined in the random dance play under disguise but it was later revealed to be him in their tour documentary.
<br>
After all the fun activities have ended outside the venue, it is time to go inside and enjoy the actual main event. While waiting for the artists to take the stage, those who bought lightsticks use this time to set up their bluetooth connection to sync to the venue. Music videos of the artists will be playing on screens to get the crowd hyped up for the real performance and many fans sing along together hoping to reach the ears of their idols behind the stage. Eventually the lights go dim, the crowd begins to roar, and the concert starts. Kpop concerts do not have opening acts like western concerts do, instead they are 3 hours worth of music, dancing, ments which are talking segments and videos that are conceptualized and often tell a story related to the kpop artists music videos. Kpop concerts are very long festivities but they are so fun to experience.
