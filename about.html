<p>Hello, I am Heather. Currently a Junior studying ITI at Rutgers University. I am a commuter student and am taking on this project to improve and learn to better myself about how I handle my 'trash' and declutter my life. Also clean my room cause it was messy and needed some good TLC. I have a habit of cleaning and reorganizing my room at night, clearly I am a night owl. When I am not at Rutgers, you can most likely find me at a concert. My favorite artists right now is One Ok Rock. I think life without music would be unbearable for me. Besides concerts, I also am a fan of kpop and am a member of HARU, Rutgers Kpop dance club. I think dance is something that I have recently become more passionate about. In fact I have prioritized it more over Tennis which is my favorite hobby, and used to play competitevly prior to college. Circling back to the concept of trash, I was once very passionate about the Environment and was the President of my high school's Environmental Club. I think that society today has lost its touch with the idea of using products that focus on longevity. I hope that through this project, I can analyze my own items, their lifespan, and see how I chose to discard things.   </p></html>
